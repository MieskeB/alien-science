## Story

**WARNING, THIS CHAPTER CONTAINS SPOILERS!**

### Testing tent

To start this story, you need to find a testing tent. These tents are scattered around the world and will contain a book
which gives you more information. It is important that you do NOT mine the *MOB tester* blocks. This is required to do
with silk touch.

After having a look at the book and solving the weird text, you'll find that the aliens create testing facilities around
the world. Testing facilities only spawn in Dark Oak forests underground. You'll also find a crafting recipe an *alien
finder*. This alien finder can be crafted with *alien blood* (obtained by killing an alien), some *stick*s and some
*redstone*.

Obtaining *alien extract* is also possible from this point. If you place an alien on top of the *MOB tester*, you can
rightclick the *MOB tester* with a glass bottle to extract the *alien extract*. Don't forget to name the alien to
prevent despawning.

### Testing facility

Now using the alien finder in a dark oak biome, you can locate the alien facility. This facility is swarming with
aliens. When wearing the following clothing, the aliens will see you as one of them.

- an *alien head* (crafted using *alien blood* and *alien extract*)
- a blue leather chestplate
- brown leggings
- black shoes

If you destroy one of the blocks in the alien testing facility, the aliens will still aggro against you. Find your way
around the facility to find some extra recipes and clues to why the aliens are invading the overworld. In this facility
you'll also find items and clues how to build a rocket for interstellar travel.
